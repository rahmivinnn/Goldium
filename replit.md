# Overview

This is a full-stack DeFi application built for Solana mainnet that enables users to swap, send, and stake SOL and GOLD (Goldium) tokens. The application provides a comprehensive DeFi experience with wallet integration supporting multiple Solana wallets (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack), token swapping capabilities, transfers, and a staking system with rewards.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Educational content: English language only, comprehensive blockchain and DeFi modules.
Performance requirements: Instant balance detection (5 seconds max), smooth animations without lag.
**STRICT REQUIREMENT**: Absolutely NO mock data - all transactions must be REAL blockchain operations using actual wallet balances.
**PRODUCTION GRADE**: All features must work with authentic wallet connections for client presentation.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

The client is built using React with TypeScript and follows a modern component-based architecture:

- **Framework**: React with Vite for fast development and building
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components for accessibility and consistency
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom DeFi-themed design system including gradient colors and dark theme
- **Wallet Integration**: Solana wallet adapter supporting multiple wallets with persistent connections

## Backend Architecture

The server uses a lightweight Express.js setup with minimal API surface:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Architecture**: RESTful API with route registration pattern
- **Storage**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation (ready for database integration)
- **Development**: Vite integration for seamless full-stack development experience

## Blockchain Integration

The application integrates directly with Solana mainnet:

- **Network**: Solana mainnet-beta with configurable RPC endpoints
- **Token Support**: Native SOL and custom SPL token (GOLD/Goldium)
- **Transaction Handling**: Full transaction lifecycle management with confirmation tracking
- **Wallet Support**: Multi-wallet compatibility with auto-reconnection features

## Component Structure

The frontend is organized into logical feature-based components:

- **Balance Management**: Instant balance detection using REAL wallet connection (0.032454 SOL actual balance)
- **Swap Interface**: REAL token exchange using authentic blockchain transactions with external wallet signing
- **Transfer System**: REAL SOL transfers to any Solana address using actual wallet balance with blockchain confirmation
- **Staking Platform**: REAL SOL staking with authentic blockchain transactions and rewards tracking
- **Educational Hub**: 6 comprehensive blockchain modules in English with interactive learning paths
- **Three.js Animations**: Optimized particle systems and geometric visualizations without performance lag
- **Transaction History**: Complete transaction tracking with Solscan integration

## Data Flow Architecture

The application uses a unidirectional data flow pattern:

- **React Query**: Handles API calls, caching, and state synchronization
- **Wallet Adapter**: Manages wallet connections and transaction signing
- **Solana Service**: Abstracted blockchain interaction layer
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate business logic for token operations and wallet management
